# Java Refresher

This repository is a personal project for revisiting and refreshing Java programming skills. I am currently going into my second year at the University of Guelph, and this project serves as a way to strengthen my understanding of Java after not programming in it for a while.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

- **Relearning Java:** To go over fundamental Java concepts and gradually move towards more advanced topics, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Self-Study:** To use this project as a self-learning tool, allowing me to track my progress and revisit areas where I need improvement.
- **Showcasing Skills:** To provide potential employers with a tangible example of my ongoing efforts to improve my programming skills and my commitment to continuous learning.
